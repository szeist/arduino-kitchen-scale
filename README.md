# Arduino Kitchen Scale with binary display

## Parts

1. 1x HX711 Load cell amplifier
3. 1x Straight bar load cell (2kg)
4. 1x Charlieplexed led array with 12 leds *(See schematics)*

## Requirements

1. [HX711_ADC](https://github.com/olkal/HX711_ADC) library
2. [CHPLX12](https://github.com/szeist/CHPLX12) library

## Calibrate

### 1. Upload calibration firmware

Define CALIBRATE_MODE in `firmware.ino`, complile and upload the firmware.

### 2. Put a known weightd item to the scale and use the serial interface for calibration

Connect to the serial port and use the following keys to adjust the measured weight:

| Key | Calibration Value |
| --- | ----------------- |
| `h` | +1                |
| `H` | +10               |
| `l` | -1                |
| `L` | -10               |
| `t` | Tare              |

### 3. Update the calibration factor

Update the `DEFAULT_CAL_FACTOR` in the `firmware.ino` with the new CalFactor value.

## Display

### Generate gerber files for production

1. Plot the following layers:
    - F.Cu
    - B.Cu
    - B.SilkS
    - F.SilkS
    - B.Mask
    - F.Mask
    - Edge.Cuts
  with options:
    - [X] Use Protel filename extensions
    - [ ] Include extended attributes
    - [ ] Subtract soldermask from silkscreen

2. Generate drill file with the following options:
    - **Millimeters** as drill units
    - **Supress leading** zeros as zeros format
    - **PostScript** as drill map format

3. Rename all files with the `schematics/scripts/rename_gerber_files.sh` script
